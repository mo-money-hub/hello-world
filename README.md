# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow
My name is Morgan.
I am 33years old. 
I am practing Python right now, and learning about GitHub.
I did some schooling for software engineering. I was half through my degree when I realized I was in over my head.
I decided to take some time off to hone my skills so I'm basically starting over and perfecting the basics. 
Looking for fun beginner projects to do to help practice.
